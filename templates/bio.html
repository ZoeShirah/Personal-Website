<h3>Zoe Shirah Gotch-Strain</h3>
<h4>Software Engineer</h4>

<p>
Zoe graduated from University of California Santa Cruz with a Bachelor's Degree in Astrophysics. She got her first taste of software engineering with an Intro to C class she loved. After graduation, Zoe worked in an Astrophysics research lab where she enjoyed work on the command line and digging into documentation. She then transitioned to working at a medical office where she greatly improved her interpersonal skills, all the while continuing her love of programming by taking 3 Java classes at the local community college. The more classes she took, the more she realized her passion for the logic and problem solving of engineering. Now, sheâ€™s at Hackbright and is seeking an opportunity to continue solving problems on an engineering team.
